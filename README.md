#  Data Science Learnings Repository

**Author:** Damilola Olatoye  
**Goal:** Build a strong, hands-on foundation in data science concepts and tools through focused, practical projects.  

---

##  Overview
This repository documents my **data science learning journey**, covering essential skills from **Python programming** to **machine learning and deep learning**.  
Each folder contains a focused mini-project or notebook designed to reinforce both **conceptual understanding** and **practical application**.

All projects are built around real-world, data-driven use cases, demonstrating the end-to-end workflow of a modern data scientist: from data extraction to visualization, modeling, and insight communication.

##  Project Areas

| # | Project Area | Description | Example Focus |
|---|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **1** | **Python Fundamentals & Programming** | Core Python concepts: syntax, data types, loops, functions, OOP, and error handling. | Implement small utilities, automation scripts, or a CLI-based project. |
| **2** | **Data Cleaning with Pandas** | Explore data preprocessing, handling missing values, outliers, and data transformation. | Clean and reshape messy datasets to make them analysis-ready. |
| **3** | **Data Analysis with SQL** | Perform structured data analysis using SQL queries. | Query relational databases for customer insights or financial KPIs. |
| **4** | **Data Visualization** | Communicate insights effectively using visual tools and libraries. | Use `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `plotly` to create dashboards and analytical visuals. |
| **5** | **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project** | Investigate data patterns, relationships, and trends using statistics and visuals. | Perform EDA on a real dataset — uncovering patterns and actionable insights. |
| **6** | **Machine Learning Basics** | Build and evaluate supervised and unsupervised ML models. | Implement regression, classification, and clustering algorithms with scikit-learn. |
| **7** | **Deep Learning** | Understand and apply neural network concepts using modern frameworks. | Build a simple ANN or CNN for text or image classification tasks. |
| **8** | **API & Web Scraping** | Learn to extract and integrate external data sources using APIs and web scraping tools. | Pull financial, weather, or product data via APIs or HTML parsing. |
